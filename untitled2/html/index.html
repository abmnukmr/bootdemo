            The Courageous class was the first British multi-ship class of aircraft carriers. The three ships—Furious, Courageous and Glorious—were originally laid down as battlecruisers to be used in the Baltic Project during the First World War. They were very fast, but their minimal armour and guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, until they were converted to aircraft carriers as permitted by the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty. Furious, already partially converted during the war, began reconstruction in 1921. As the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, the ship was used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. During the Second World War, Courageous became the first British warship lost, torpedoed in September 1939 by a German submarine. Glorious, sailing home with minimal escort after the Norwegian Campaign, was sunk by two German battleships in June 1940. Furious ferried aircraft, escorted convoys and launched air attacks in support of British forces until late 1944. (Full article...)

            The "Alan Turing Law" is an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The provision is named after Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker and computing pioneer, who was convicted for gross indecency in 1952. Turing received a royal pardon (posthumously) in 2013. The law applies in England and Wales.
            Several proposals had been put forward for an Alan Turing law,[1][2][3] and introducing such a law has been government policy since 2015.[4] To implement the pardon, the British Government announced on 20 October 2016 that it would support an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill that would provide a posthumous pardon, also providing an automatic formal pardon for living people who had had such offences removed from their record.[5][6] A rival bill to implement the Alan Turing law, in second reading at the time of the government announcement, was filibustered.[7] The bill received royal assent on 31 January 2017, and the pardon was implemented that same day.[8] The law only provides pardons for men convicted of acts that are no longer offences—those convicted under the same laws of offences that would now be classified as cottaging, underage sex, or rape will not be pardoned.[9]

               <h4 style="text-align:center;font-size: large">Bootstrap</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any sort of interest in web development, you’ve likely heard of
                    Bootstrap. According to the official website, Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework
                    for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Sounds great! Now how do I use it?

                It would be easy to send you over to their Getting Started page and call it a day. Their setup guide is indeed
                    a host of useful information – links to CDNs, explanations on how to install with
                Bower, npm, and Composer, information on integration with Autoprefixer and LESS, a bunch of templates, licenses,
                    and translations – but it is certainly not a step by step guide to getting started (which very well might be
                    in the spirit of autodidactism).

                <h4 class="text" style="text-align: center;">Github</h4>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an
                    open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds – the same person who created Linux.
                    Git is similar to other version control systems – Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

                Version control systems

                So, Git is a “version control system,” what’s that mean? When developers are creating something (an application,
                    for example), they are making constant changes to the code and releasing new versions, up to and after the
                    first official (non-beta) release.

                Version control systems keep these revisions straight, and store the modifications in a central repository.
                    This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make
                    changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and
                    contribute.

                Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and
                    use them. Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other
                    similar method is pretty common for downloading needed files, especially in preparation for compiling a
                    program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks)

                        What is HTML?<br><br>
                        HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:
                        Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.
                        Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
                        Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
                        Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
                        With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.
                       <br> <br>What is XHTML?<br><br>
                        XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML, the Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application, you can use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming XML content).
                       <br><br> What is CSS?<br><br>
                        CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.
